# Cisco_packet-tracer-project
Final year computer science networking project
# 🛰️ Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design and Configuration Project

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design, simulation, and configuration of multiple network topologies using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It is divided into two main parts:  
- **Part I:** Network Topology Design, Simulation, and Documentation  
- **Part II:** Configuration and demonstration of an assigned **unique network feature**  

All work is documented in this repository and accompanied by a ** demonstration video**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### Part I – Network Topologies Design & Simulation
Design, configure, and test the following topologies in Cisco Packet Tracer:
1. **Bus Topology**
2. **Mesh Topology**
3. **Star Topology**
4. **Ring Topology**
5. **Extended Star Topology**
6. **Hybrid Topology** (integrating elements of the above)

#### Hybrid Topology Requirements:
- Configured for both **IPv4** and **IPv6**
- **VLAN segmentation**
- one functional server (HTTP/DNS/DHCP)
- **Basic network security** implementation
- Full documentation including:
  - IP Address Tables  
  - Screenshots  
  - Configuration Notes  
  - README.md file (this document)

---

### Part II – Individual Network Feature Configuration
Each student is assigned a **unique network feature** to configure and integrate into the existing topologies or a small network.  
Requirements:
- Correctly configure and test the feature  
- Document all steps and commands in this `README.md`  
- Demonstrate the feature in the project video  

---

### Part III – Video Demonstration 
A  demonstration video showing:
- Explanation and walkthrough of all topologies  
- Configuration steps and results  
- Testing and evidence of functionality (e.g., successful pings, packet simulations)  
- Integration and testing of the assigned feature  
- Reflection on **challenges**, **solutions**, and **lessons learned**

**Video Guidelines:**
- Presenter must appear on camera (inset view)
- Good audio and video quality required
- Structure:
  - **Part 1:** All topologies and their configurations  
  - **Part 2:** Assigned network feature demonstration  
  - **Testing:** Packet exchanges and connectivity  
  - **Reflection:** Lessons learned and final remarks
